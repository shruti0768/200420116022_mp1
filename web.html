            <h2>INDIAN CRAFT</h2>

            <p>
                Traditional crafts can be as simple as a basket or as complicated as fine woven silk. Whether it is a
                rug, a knitted sweater, an iron hinge, or a hunting decoy, people often invest time and effort, beyond
                what is needed for basic necessity, to produce crafts that are pleasing to the eye.Some of the numerous
                tribal crafts manufactured in India include: Antiques, Art, Baskets, Paper Mache, Ceramics, Clock
                Making, Embroidery, Block Printing, Decorative Painting, Glass Work, Fabric, Furniture, Gifts, Home
                Décor, Jewellery, Leather Crafts, Metal Crafts, Paper Crafts, Pottery, Puppets, Stone and Wood
                Works.They help us understand the history of the people who made them and their significance. The
                traditional crafts are a constant reminder of a slow and green life being part of our culture. Lorem

            <h2>Indian Pottery</h2>
            <p>India is a land where exporting is much a requirement than a favorite option. It is a very populated land
                where trade and business will be the need of the hour. India can be a leader in different fields, and
                the large quantity of few specialized items may afford it to export such items. Whenever we discuss the
                Indian Export Business, do we readily think of Handicraft industry? Not really, because Agriculture as a
                most important export area is a famous and favorite concept, overshadowing numerous other fields. India
                is one of the most important exporters of handicrafts and artistic items. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

            <h2>Designed Wood</h2>
            <p>Woodwork has a significant impact on children's self-esteem and confidence and it develops a sense of
                agency that “can-do” mindset. Woodwork is a medium for children to express their creativity and
                imagination. It is important not to set projects whereby all the children create the same object.
                Pyrography or pyrogravure is the free handed art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks
                resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a poker. It is also known as
                pokerwork or wood burning.Walnut, cherry, maple, oak and others are regarded as premier cabinet lumber.
                They're commercially viable because a lumber yard can guarantee an inventory of these species. Lorem,
