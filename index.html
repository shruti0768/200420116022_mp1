    <h2>EUROPE</h2>
    <p>Europe is a continent that is part of Eurasia and is located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and
      mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. Comprising the westernmost peninsulas of Eurasia, it shares the continental
      landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic
      Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be
      separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus,
      the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi),
      or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent
      model).Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most
      populous,spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of
      about 745 million(about 10% of the world population) in 2021. The European climate is largely affected by warm
      Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the
      climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than
      close to the coast.

        COLOSSEUM AMPHITHEATRE

    <h2>COLOSSEUM</h2>
    <p>The Colosseum is an amphitheatre built in Rome under the Flavian emperors of the Roman Empire. It is also called
      the Flavian Amphitheatre. It is an elliptical structure made of stone, concrete, and tuff, and it stands four
      stories tall at its highest point. It measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 metres) and could hold as many as
      50,000 spectators. The Colosseum was famously used for gladiatorial combat.Construction of the Colosseum began
      under the Roman emperor Vespasian between 70 and 72 CE. The completed structure was dedicated in 80 CE by Titus,
      Vespasian's son and successor. The Colosseum's fourth story was added by the emperor Domitian in 82 CE.
      Importantly, the arena was paid for with plunder from Titus's sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and it was built by
      enslaved Jews from Judaea.The Colosseum was built as part of an imperial effort to revitalize Rome after the
      tumultuous year of the four emperors, 69 CE. As with other amphitheatres, the emperor Vespasian intended the
      Colosseum to be an entertainment venue, hosting gladiator fights, animal hunts, and even mock naval battles.
      The Colosseum fell into serious disrepair after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. During the 12th century, the
      Frangipane and Annibaldi families repurposed the arena to function as their fortress. In the late 15th century,
      Pope Alexander VI permitted the Colosseum to be used as a quarry. After over a thousand years of neglect,
      state-funded restoration efforts began in the 1990s.

    <h2>EIFFEL TOWER</h2>
    <p>When the French government was organizing the International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the
      French Revolution, a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted,
      and the Centennial Committee chose that of the noted bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel. When completed, the Eiffel
      Tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.The Eiffel Tower was initially built to serve as the
      entrance gateway to the International Exposition of 1889 as well as a testament to French industrial ingenuity. It
      has since come to represent the distinct character of the city of Paris. Its lights are also often turned on or
      off to reflect commemoration of major world events.The Eiffel Tower is made almost entirely of open-lattice
      wrought iron. Gustave Eiffel used his advanced knowledge of the behaviour of metal arch and metal truss forms
      under loading to design a light and airy but strong structure that presaged a revolution in civil engineering and
      architectural design.The Eiffel Tower can be seen sparkling every night for five minutes each hour, at the precise
      start of the hour. The current lighting system has been in place since 1985, though the tower has been lit up in
      various fashions since its 1889 debut for the International Exposition, when gaslights were used.
